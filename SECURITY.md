# Security Guidelines

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Exchange Platform v3 and best practices for secure deployment and operation.

## Overview

The Exchange Platform v3 implements multiple layers of security to protect against common threats and ensure data integrity across multi-tenant environments.

## Security Architecture

### 1. Tenant Isolation

**Complete Data Separation**
- Every database query automatically includes tenant filtering
- Middleware enforces tenant boundaries at the API level
- Cross-tenant data access is prevented through multiple validation layers

**Implementation Details:**
- All models include `tenantId` field with proper indexing
- Query enforcement middleware automatically adds tenant filters
- JWT tokens include tenant context for authorization
- Security logging tracks tenant isolation violations

### 2. Authentication & Authorization

**JWT-Based Authentication**
- Secure token generation with configurable expiration
- Refresh token support for enhanced security
- Token validation on every protected route

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
- Hierarchical role system: Super Admin > Tenant Admin > Manager > Staff > Customer
- Granular permissions for fine-grained access control
- Resource-level authorization checks

**Security Features:**
- Password hashing with bcrypt (configurable rounds)
- Account lockout after failed login attempts
- Session management with secure invalidation

### 3. Input Validation & Sanitization

**Data Validation**
- Joi schema validation for all API inputs
- Express-validator for request parameter validation
- Custom validation middleware for business rules

**Security Sanitization**
- MongoDB injection prevention with express-mongo-sanitize
- XSS protection with xss-clean middleware
- Input escaping for user-generated content

### 4. Security Middleware Stack

**Rate Limiting**
- Configurable rate limits per endpoint type
- Redis-backed rate limiting for distributed deployments
- Specific limits for authentication endpoints

**Security Headers**
- Helmet.js for security headers
- CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
- Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation

### 5. Logging & Monitoring

**Security Event Logging**
- Authentication success/failure logging
- Authorization violation tracking
- Tenant isolation violation alerts
- Suspicious activity detection

**Audit Trail**
- Comprehensive database operation logging
- User action tracking with context
- System performance monitoring

## Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

```bash
# Authentication
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secure-jwt-secret-key-minimum-32-characters
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your-super-secure-refresh-secret-key-minimum-32-characters
SESSION_SECRET=your-session-secret-key-minimum-32-characters

# Database Security
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://username:password@localhost:27017/exchange_platform
CUSTOMER_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-customer-data-encryption-key-32-bytes

# Security Settings
BCRYPT_ROUNDS=12                    # Password hashing rounds (10-12 recommended)
LOG_LEVEL=info                      # Logging level (error, warn, info, debug)

# Rate Limiting
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000         # 15 minutes in milliseconds
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=100         # Max requests per window
RATE_LIMIT_AUTH_MAX=10              # Max auth attempts per window
```

### Security Headers Configuration

The application automatically applies the following security headers:

- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`
- `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'`

## Deployment Security

### Production Checklist

- [ ] Use HTTPS only (no HTTP)
- [ ] Configure firewall rules (allow only necessary ports)
- [ ] Enable MongoDB authentication and encryption
- [ ] Use Redis authentication
- [ ] Set strong environment variables
- [ ] Enable application logging
- [ ] Configure monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Regular security updates
- [ ] Backup strategy implementation

### Infrastructure Security

**Database Security:**
- Enable MongoDB authentication
- Use TLS/SSL for database connections
- Configure IP whitelisting
- Enable audit logging
- Implement backup encryption

**Cache Security:**
- Enable Redis authentication
- Use TLS for Redis connections
- Configure memory limits
- Monitor cache performance

**Network Security:**
- Use VPC or private networks
- Configure load balancer SSL termination
- Implement DDoS protection
- Monitor network traffic

## Security Monitoring

### Health Checks

The application provides several endpoints for monitoring:

- `GET /health` - Comprehensive system health
- `GET /health/ready` - Kubernetes readiness probe
- `GET /health/live` - Kubernetes liveness probe
- `GET /metrics` - Prometheus metrics
- `GET /health/alerts` - Security alerts

### Log Analysis

Security logs are structured for easy analysis:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "level": "warn",
  "event": "AUTH_FAILED",
  "reason": "Invalid credentials",
  "ip": "192.168.1.1",
  "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
  "tenantId": "tenant_id_here"
}
```

### Alerting

The system generates alerts for:
- Failed authentication attempts (threshold-based)
- Tenant isolation violations
- Unusual API usage patterns
- System performance degradation
- Database connectivity issues

## Incident Response

### Security Event Response

1. **Detection**: Monitor logs and alerts
2. **Assessment**: Determine severity and scope
3. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
4. **Investigation**: Analyze logs and system state
5. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
6. **Documentation**: Record incident details

### Common Security Events

**Failed Authentication**
- Monitor for brute force attempts
- Implement account lockout policies
- Alert on unusual login patterns

**Tenant Isolation Violations**
- Immediately log and alert
- Investigate user permissions
- Review application code for vulnerabilities

**Suspicious API Usage**
- Monitor rate limit violations
- Track unusual data access patterns
- Implement additional rate limiting if needed

## Security Testing

### Automated Testing

The application includes comprehensive security tests:

- Authentication bypass attempts
- Authorization violation tests
- Tenant isolation validation
- Input validation testing
- Rate limiting verification

### Manual Testing

Regular security assessments should include:

- Penetration testing
- Code security reviews
- Dependency vulnerability scanning

## Compliance

### Data Protection

The platform implements measures for:
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Audit logging for compliance requirements
- Data retention policies
- User consent management

### Industry Standards

- OWASP Top 10 guidelines
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- ISO 27001 principles
- PCI DSS requirements (where applicable)
